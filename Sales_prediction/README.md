This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditure data. Using the advertising.csv dataset, which includes data on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates future sales. By analyzing the relationship between advertising spend and sales, the model will help optimize marketing strategies and improve return on investment.
