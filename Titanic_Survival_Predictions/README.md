This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the train.csv and test.csv datasets. By analyzing various features such as passenger class, age, gender, and other socio-economic factors, we build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival. This analysis helps understand the impact of different factors on survival rates and provides insights into the demographics of the Titanic's passengers.
